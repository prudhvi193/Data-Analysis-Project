# Data-Analysis-Project
The purpose of this project is to examine whether stretching and wearing ankle weights would provide exercise benefits using treadmill based on energy consumption in number of calories.

Software Used: SAS Programming, Microsoft Excel

Program File Name: Project_Code.txt: Consists the implementation of the algorithm used to solve the given problem for the project and once the result is generated we can draw the conclusions based on them accordingly.

Input Data Files: Treadmill Exercise.xls: This is a data file obtained from the SAS library with around 20 entries which explains about the PreStretch,AnkleWeights,Energy,Speed,Oxygen consumed while performing the exercise.

Output Data Files: These details are briefly explained in the report attached for the following project in the file named "STAT5023 Data Analysis Project".

Image Files "a.jpg,b.jpg,c.jpg" shows the snapshots obtained after running the code in the SAS software tool.
